## Summary

This project was done for my second year undergraduate C++ module, to demonstrate use of object oriented programming. 

I am particularly proud of this work as I spent a lot of time reimagining and reworking the structure, until it became both simple and functional. 

Working on this taught me a great deal about not only object oriented programming itself, but also researching alternative methods of achieving my programming goals.
